# NetworkX : Python software package for study of complex networks
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and function of 
# complex networks. It is used to study large complex networks represented in form of graphs with nodes and edges. Using networkx we can load and store complex networks. 
# We can generate many types of random and classic networks, analyze network structure, build network models, design new network algorithms and draw networks. 

# Installation of the package: 

# pip install networkx
# Creating Nodes

# Add one node at a time: 

#  G.add_node(1)
# Add a list of nodes: 

#  G.add_nodes_from([2,3])
# Let us create nodes in the graph G. After adding nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 

# Python program to create an undirected
# graph and add nodes and edges to a graph

# To import package
import networkx

# To create an empty undirected graph
G = networkx.Graph()

# To add a node
G.add_node(1)
G.add_node(2)
G.add_node(3)
G.add_node(4)
G.add_node(7)
G.add_node(9)

# To add an edge
# Note graph is undirected
# Hence order of nodes in edge doesn't matter
G.add_edge(1,2)
G.add_edge(3,1)
G.add_edge(2,4)
G.add_edge(4,1)
G.add_edge(9,1)
G.add_edge(1,7)
G.add_edge(2,9)



# To get all the nodes of a graph
node_list = G.nodes()
print("#1")
print(node_list)

# To get all the edges of a graph
edge_list = G.edges()
print("#2")
print(edge_list)

# To remove a node of a graph
G.remove_node(3)
node_list = G.nodes()
print("#3")
print(node_list)

# To remove an edge of a graph
G.remove_edge(1,2)
edge_list = G.edges()
print("#4")
print(edge_list)

# To find number of nodes
n = G.number_of_nodes()
print("#5")
print(n)

# To find number of edges
m = G.number_of_edges()
print("#6")
print(m)

# To find degree of a node
# d will store degree of node 2
d = G.degree(2)
print("#7")
print(d)

# To find all the neighbor of a node
neighbor_list = G.neighbors(2)
print("#8")
print(neighbor_list)

#To delete all the nodes and edges
G.clear()
